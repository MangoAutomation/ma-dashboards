<h1>Mango Javascript API</h1>
<p>The Mango Javascript API has been developed to assist in bringing Mango's data onto your web pages.  Check the tutorials on the sidbar at the bottom for real world examples.</p>
 <p>This page is a simple way to navigate through the example dashboards provided in the module.  Some pages require manual 
configuration before they will work so don't be alarmed if they fail to load properly.  Most will require linking some point 
XIDs from your instance into the page.</p>
<p>A simple way to get started:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Create 2 Numeric points in your instance with xids: temperature and voltage</li>
       <li>Create 1 Multistate point with xid: multistate</li>
       <li>Create 1 Binary point with xid: binary</li>
       <li>Ensure all points are settable</li>
       <li>Ensure all points have data and are regularly being updated</li>
       <li>Create a folder named 'Target Folder' at the root of the point hierarchy that contains these points</li> 
   </ul>
