<h1>Mango Custom Dashboards</h1>

<h3>Welcome to Mango's Custom Dashboards Module</h3>

<p>Custom Dashboards are a powerful way to create dynamic visualization screens for your customers.  They are designed to both impress and offer superior functionality and performance.  The development environment is designed for rapid development and deployment.</p>

<p>Start off by exploring the live demos under the Examples menu item. You can then copy
mark-up into the <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.playArea">play area</a> or copy the code into an entirely new page.
The Custom Dashboards Module now supports user created pages and total customization of the menu.
<a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.basics.pagesAndMenu">Learn more</a> on how to create pages and edit the menu.
</p>

<p>The new custom dashboards module leverages Angular, the powerful  javascript framework, along with <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/" target="_blank">Angular Material</a>
 to provide a set of UI components and a theming model for creating beautiful and modern frontends that utilize the mango backend.
In reality you will not have to use any javascript at all. You will only need to understand how to use our custom HTML components.</p>

<p>
	We have added documentation for every component used to create a dashboard. Detailed descriptions of every parameter and attribute is available in the API Docs section.
