        <code>Mango Automation</code> is a powerful tool for a wide variety of applications. 
        If you're interested in <code>Integrating, Evaluating,</code> and <code>Visualizing</code> multiple data streams over time, 
        you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish after only a little learning.
    </p>

    <p>
		<code>Mango 3.0</code> is bringing you a refreshed UI experience utilizing a modern single page application framework.
		We have created new versions of our <a ui-sref="dashboard.watchList">Watchlist</a>, 
		<a ui-sref="dashboard.events">Events</a>, and <a ui-sref="dashboard.dataPointDetails">Data Point Details</a> pages.
		They are designed to be faster, look great on any screen size, and provide more functionality then ever before.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have added a built in <code>CMS</code> like experience that allows you to create your own dashboard pages using our
		<a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.editPages">Page Editor</a> and library of <code>Mango UI Components</code>.
		They are designed to both impress and offer superior functionality and performance over previous methods of creating
		graphical views. The development environment is designed for rapid development and deployment by utilizing high level
		HTML coding with our <code>UI Components</code> and <code>Templates</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Interactive <code>Demos</code> and <code>Live Previews</code> can be found under <code>Examples</code> in the menu.
		Full documentation of all parameters of each component can be found under <code>API Docs</code>.
		<a ui-sref="dashboard.help.customPages">Learn more</a> about how to create pages and edit the menu to customize Mango to your needs.
	</p>

	<p>
		All legacy pages can be accessed from the menu on the left. The menu itself is completely 
		<a ui-sref="dashboard.help.menuEditor">customizable</a>, allowing you to reorder and
		hide items, as well as create a hierarchy of your own custom pages. If you want to change the look and feel of the app you can change
		theme colors and set your own logo with the <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.dashboardSettings">Dashboard Settings</a> page.
	</p>

	<p>
		For more information on all the featues of the new UI see the other pages under the <code>Help</code> menu item.

    <h2>Navigation</h2>

        The menu on the left is used to access all pages. Our new pages as well as the legacy UI pages 
        can be accessed via the sidebar menu.
