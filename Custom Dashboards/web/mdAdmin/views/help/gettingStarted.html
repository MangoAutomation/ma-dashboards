    <em>Mango Automation</em> is a powerful tool for a wide variety of applications. 
    If you're interested in integrating, evaluating, and visualizing multiple data streams over time, 
    you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish after only a little learning.
</p>

<p>
    Our UI has been completely rebuilt to offer a modern single page application experience. 
    Many new features have been introduced including a fully responsive component based UI framework, 
    a new advanced watchlist building and viewing system, and the ability
    to create custom dashboard pages and visualizations all within the app.

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>
    The menu on the left is used to access all pages. Our new pages as well as the legacy UI pages 
    can be accessed via the sidebar menu. The currently logged in user information will be displayed at the top of the menu, 
    under the logo and server time. You can click the username drop down to logout of Mango. 
    The sidebar menu will automatically hide on mobile views. 
    If you like you, can click the three dashes menu icon to hide/expand the menu manually when viewing 
    on smaller desktop screens.

<p>
    The <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.dashboardSettings">Dashboard Settings</a> page can be used to change the entire 
    color scheme of the dashboard as well as switch the logo with your own image. You can edit the menu structure 
    itself by adding/hiding/reordering menu items on the <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.dashboardSettings">Edit Menu</a> page.
