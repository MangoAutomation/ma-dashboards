        Our UI has been completely rebuilt to offer a modern single page application experience. 
        Many new features have been introduced including a fully responsive component based UI framework, 
        a new advanced watchlist building and viewing system, and the ability
        to create custom dashboard pages and visualizations all within the app.

    <h2>Navigation</h2>

    <p>
        The menu on the left is used to access all pages. Our new pages as well as the legacy UI pages 
        can be accessed via the sidebar menu.

        The currently logged in user information will be displayed at the top of the menu,
