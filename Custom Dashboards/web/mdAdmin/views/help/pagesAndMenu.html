		Custom dashboard pages can be created from within the app itself, using our 
		built in code editor and UI component library. Basic HTML code can be used 
		to create beautiful and dynamic dashboards that are integrated into the app. 
		Examples of how to use our components, and full documentation of each 
		component can be found under the Examples and API Docs menu items.
	</p>

	<p>
		Under <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.editPages">Settings > Edit Pages</a> you 
		will find the page editor tool. You can use this tool to manage all of your custom pages, 
		including creating new pages, setting permissions, deleting pages and modifying a
		pages menu item. You will need to enter the HTML into the code editor on the left. 
		You will see a live preview on the right as you enter code. 
		At any time you can save and view the page in full screen.
	</p>
	<p> 
		A quick way to get started is to click the
		<code>Copy markup to new custom page</code> link from any of the example pages. 
		You will first give the page a name and hit save. You can then add a menu item 
		for your new custom page by clicking the <code>ADD/EDIT MENU ITEM</code> button.
	</p>

	<p>
		 If you are looking to start with a pre-made layout you can also copy one of 
		 the <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.templates.adaptiveLayouts">Adaptive Layout</a> 
		 pages as a starting point. You can then copy and paste in the components into the pre-built card layouts.
	<p>
		You will then want to give the menu item a parent item, state URL, menu text, and menu icon. 
		The entire menu is completely customizable from the <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.editMenu">Settings > Edit Menu</a> 
		page. You can hide/show menu items, edit menu item text and icons, reorder menu items, add new menu 
		items and delete custom menu items.
	</p>

	<h2>Permissions</h2>

	<p>
		By default, all pages that are created can be viewed by all users and require 
		the user to have the <strong>edit-pages</strong> permission to edit them. 
		If you want to restrict the pages to be viewable only by
		admin users, change the read permission to <strong>superadmin</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Users with the <strong>edit-menus</strong> permission can edit the menus. 
		When editing the menu items you can set a permission for each menu item, 
		if the user does not have this permission then the menu item will not be shown.
	</p>

	<h2>Adding Your Own Images</h2>

	<p>
		If you would like to include your own images on a page you can put them in an 
		image folder in your overrides. Create a new folder at
		<code>${MA_HOME}/overrides/web/modules/dashboards/web/images</code> and place 
		your image files in there. You can then insert the image onto a page using:
		<code ng-non-bindable>&lt;img ng-src="/modules/dashboards/web/images/myImage.png" alt="My Image"/&gt;</code>
