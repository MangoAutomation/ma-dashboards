		Custom pages can be created from within the app's <code>CMS</code> environment, using our 
		built in <code>Code Editor</code> and <code>UI Component Library</code> to create and link new pages to the app.
		Mango's <code>HTML Web Components</code> combined with <code>Angular</code> 
		templating logic allows you to create simple or complex dynamic pages that pull data
		from Mango's database and visualize the data as responsive interface elements, charts and tables.
		Interactive demos and examples can be found under the <code>Examples</code> menu section.
		Full documentation of all parameters of each component can be found under <code>API Docs.</code>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.editPages">Page Editor</a> can be found under <code>Settings > Edit Pages</code> in the menu.
		You can use this tool to manage all of your custom pages.

	<p>
		The inputs above the button row allow you to choose a pre-existing page to edit, update the name of a page, and set the page's permissions.
		<code>Read / Edit Permissions</code> can be used to prevent access to a page. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Permissions</h2>

	<p>
		By default, all pages that are created can be viewed by all users and require 
		the user to have the <strong>edit-pages</strong> permission to edit them. 
		If you want to restrict the pages to be viewable only by
		admin users, change the read permission to <strong>superadmin</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Users with the <strong>edit-menus</strong> permission can edit the menus. 
		When editing the menu items you can set a permission for each menu item, 
		if the user does not have this permission then the menu item will not be shown.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The row of buttons allows you to <code>Save</code> your changes to the page you are currently editing. The <code>Revert</code>
		button will reset the code editor to the last saved state. The <code>Delete</code> button will remove a page from the sytem after confirming.
		The <code>New Page</code> button will set-up a blank page for you to work with. Be sure to <code>Save</code> changes to the previous page first.
	</p>

	<p>
		Before you can <code>Save</code> a new page you will need to name it.
	</p>

	<p> 
		You will need to enter the HTML into the code editor on the left. 
	</p>

	<p>
		You will see a live preview on the right as you enter code. 
		At any time you can save and view the page in full screen.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>View Page</code> button will open the last saved state of the page in full-screen mode in a new tab. 
		This is the same link that you can use to share the page with somebody
		and will be used by the page's <code>Menu Item.</code>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Starting from an Example or Template</h2>
	
	<p> 
		A quick way to get started is to click the
		<code>Copy markup to new custom page</code> link from any of the example pages.
		This will create a new page with the code copied into it.
	</p>

	<img src="" alt="" />
	
	<p>
		 If you are looking to start with a pre-made layout you can also copy one of 
		 the <a ui-sref="dashboard.examples.templates.adaptiveLayouts">Adaptive Layout</a> 
		 pages as a starting point. These examples give you a predefined responsive layout 
		 that you can adapt to your needs.
	</p>

	<h2>Adding a Menu Item</h2>
	<p>
		The <code>Add Edit Menu Item</code> button will open up the <code>Edit Menu Item</code> dialog.
		From here you will give the menu item a parent item, state URL, menu text, and menu icon. 
		The entire menu is completely customizable from the <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.editMenu">Settings > Edit Menu</a> 
		page. You can hide/show menu items, edit menu item text and icons, reorder menu items, add new menu 
		items and delete custom menu items.
	</p>

	<h2>Adding Your Own Images</h2>

	<p>
		If you would like to include your own images on a page you can put them in an 
		image folder in your overrides. Create a new folder at
		<code>${MA_HOME}/overrides/web/modules/dashboards/web/images</code> and place 
		your image files in there. You can then insert the image onto a page using:
		<code ng-non-bindable>&lt;img ng-src="/modules/dashboards/web/images/myImage.png" alt="My Image"/&gt;</code>
	</p>
