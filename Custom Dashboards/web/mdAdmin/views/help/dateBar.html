        To the right of the time range selector in the header bar is a calendar icon. 
        Clicking this icon will expand the date bar. Update and rollup settings will be 
        shown in the date bar as well if they apply to the selected page. The date bar 
        can be used to set a specific to-from date/time range. Clicking any of these 
        four inputs will allow you to select a date from a calendar or time from a 
        clock component that is presented in a popup. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently the date bar is used by the Watch List, Data Point Details, and Events page. 
        Rollup settings will not show on the Events page as they do not apply to that page. 
        Rollups are used to make sure a reasonable amount of data is displayed on charts and 
        point value history tables. By default auto rollup settings will be used but if you 
        turn off auto rollup you can manually specify a rollup interval. Changing rollup type 
        allows you to view rollup types other than average, such as delta, max and min. 
        *Note: If you have a non-numeric point selected on the data point details page the 
        rollup will automatically be set to none and certain rollup types will not be available.
    </p>

        If you don’t use the manually specified to/from times you will see the update options. 
        When auto update is turned on the time range will refresh on the given update interval 
        and requery for point values to use in the chart and point value history tables. 
        If you don’t have auto update selected you can use the reload icon on the far right 
        of the date bar to manually update the time range up to the current time.
