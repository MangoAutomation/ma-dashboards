<p>
    The Events page allows you to view a table of all events (also known as alarms) 
    that are stored in the system. You can filter the table by event type, alarm level, 
    active status, and whether or not the event has been acknowledged. You can sort the 
    table by clicking a column header. You can acknowledge a single event by clicking 
    the green circle on the far right of the row. You can acknowledge all events that 
    match the filter results by clicking the Acknowledge ### Events button.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any unacknowledged events in your system they will display in the 
    header bar as an alarm icon. You can see the total count as well as the breakdown 
    by alarm level by clicking the icon to expand the menu. Clicking any of these menu 
    items will open the Events page with the filters automatically set to the selected alarm level.
</p>

<p>
    *Note: If you don’t see any events after clicking one of these menu items you 
    may need to expand your time range. The events table is filtered by the time 
    range selected in the header bar so if the event is older than the selected 
    time range it won’t show up on the table.
