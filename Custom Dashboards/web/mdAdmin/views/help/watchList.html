<p>
    The <a ui-sref="dashboard.watchList">Watch List</a> page allows you to compare many data points at 
    the same time in a table view. All column names on the table can be clicked to sort ascending or 
    descending by the selected field. Point values will flash when they update. You can click the 
    checkbox on the far left of each row to add a data point to the <code>Chart and Compare</code> pane. 
    Once added to the chart you can also click the <code>Stats</code> tab to view a comparison of 
    statistics over the selected time range in the header bar.
</p>

<p>
    By default a point will be added to the chart using the the left axis and the line color set in the 
    point’s properties. This can be changed by setting the <code>Next Axis</code> radio button to something other than left. 
    The next point added to the chart will use the newly selected axis. This can be useful if you want to 
    chart a few points on the left axis that share a similar range and a some other points on the right axis 
    that share a far different range.
</p>

<p>
    If you check the <code>Pick Colors</code> checkbox you can set the line color used by the next data point added to the chart. 
    You can also change axis colors using the other color inputs. These settings will be stored next time you return 
    to the watch list.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>selected time range</code> will be used on the <code>chart</code>, <code>stats</code> tab, and <code>stats/history</code> popup which can be accessed by 
    clicking the <code>graph icon</code> to the right of the checkbox. Clicking this icon will open a popup dialog showing statistics, 
    a line chart and a point value history for the data point, corresponding to the <code>selected time range</code> in the header bar. 
    To the far right of the table row you can click the icon to link to the <a ui-sref="dashboard.help.dataPointDetails">Data Point Details</a> page for that point.
</p>

<p>
    On the left side of the <code>Watch List</code> page you can choose between custom <code>Watch Lists</code>, <code>Devices</code>, <code>Data Sources</code>, or directly 
    from folders of the <code>point hierarchy</code>. Choosing a new list will clear the chart and load the new points contained within 
    that list into the table view.
</p>

<p>
    If a data point is <code>settable</code> a <code>wrench icon</code> will display on the table row that will open a popup dialog you can use to 
    manually set a data point’s value. The appropriate interface element will be shown for <code>numeric</code> vs. 
    <codre>binary/multistate/alphanumeric</codre> type data points.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a <code>Custom Watch List</code> selected you can click the edit button to open the <a ui-sref="dashboard.help.watchListBuilder">Watch List Builder</a> page.
