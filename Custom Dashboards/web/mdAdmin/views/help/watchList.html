The Watch List page allows you to compare many data points at the same time in a table view. All column names on the table can be clicked to sort ascending or descending by the selected field. Point values will flash when they update. You can click the checkbox on the far left of each row to add a data point to the Chart and Compare pane. Once added to the chart you can also click the Stats tab to view a comparison of statistics over the selected time range in the header bar.

By default a point will be added to the chart using the the left axis and the line color set in the point’s properties. This can be changed by setting the next axis option to something other than left. The next point added to the chart will use the newly selected axis. This can be useful if you want to chart a few points on the left axis that share a similar range and a some other points on the right axis that share a far different range.

If you check the pick colors option you can set the line color used by the next data point added to the chart. You can also change axis colors use the other color options. These settings will be stored next time you return to the watch list.

The selected time range will be used on the chart, stats tab, and stats/history popup which can be accessed by clicking the graph icon to the right of the checkbox. Clicking this icon will open a popup dialog showing statistics, a line chart and a point value history for the data point, corresponding to the selected time range in the header bar. To the far right of the table row you can click the icon to link to the Data Point Details page for that point.

On the left side of the Watch List page you can choose between custom Watch Lists, Devices, Data Sources, or directly from folders of the point hierarchy. Choosing a new list will clear the chart and load the new points contained within that list into the table view.

If a data point is settable a wrench icon will display on the table row that will open a popup dialog you can use to manually set a data point’s value. The appropriate interface element will be shown for numeric vs. binary/multistate/alphanumeric type data points.

If you have a custom Watch List selected you can click the edit button to open the Watch List Builder page.
