        The <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.dashboardSettings">Dashboard Settings</a> page can be used to change the entire 
        color scheme of the dashboard as well as switch the logo with your own image. You can edit the menu structure 
        itself by adding/hiding/reordering menu items on the <a ui-sref="dashboard.settings.dashboardSettings">Edit Menu</a> page.
