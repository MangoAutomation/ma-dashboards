There is currently no help for this module as it is in development.

To create a dashboard file simply create an HTML file and place it into the web/pages folder.  The file must be postfixed with .shtm (secure html).  \

Currently only secure pages are supported, this means you must be logged in before you can access the dashboard.


Any page can be accessed via:

yourMangoHost:yourMangoPort/dashboards/<your dashboard name>.shtm

Examples:
localhost:8080/dashboards/defaultDashbaord.shtm
localhost:8080/dashboards/helloWorld.shtm
