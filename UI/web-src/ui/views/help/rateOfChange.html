<p>The Rate Of Change detector only applies to Numeric points. This
	detector is able to raise events when the rate of change of the point
	crosses its rate of change threshold. The comparison option describes
	how the computed rate of change is compared to the rate of change
	threshold. An event will be raised whenever the comparison between the
	rate of change threshold and the computed rate of change is true.
</p>
<p>If the value is increasing or decreasing there will be a positive or negative 
	rate of change respectively.  Checking <b> Use absolute value </b> 
	ensures that the comparison is done to the absolute value of the computed rate of change.
	Meaning the event will trigger whether the values increases or decreases. 
</p>
<p>Checking <b>Use reset threshold </b> will allow you to configure a reset threshold.
    If the reset threshold is crossed, the event will return to normal.  If no reset threshold
    is configured then the event will stay active and only return to normal when the comparison 
    is no longer true.
</p>

<p> <b>Instantaneous mode </b>compares the point value changes in real time against the threshold
</p>

<p> <b>Average mode</b> will compute the average change over the selected period of time to compare
 to the threshold. The rate of change for a point is computed based on how much change occurs within
  the averaging period settings, this must be greater than 0.
