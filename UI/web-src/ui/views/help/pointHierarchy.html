  <p>
    The point hierarchy can be used to arrange the points in your system in meaningful ways. This hierarchy is
    displayed
    on the watch list. Originally, all points are placed in the root of the hierarchy.

  <p>The Export data point "path" setting controls whether the path is exported in the data point JSON Configuration
    export. The Path folder separator is used as the character to separate folders in the path.
