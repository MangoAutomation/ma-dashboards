To create a dashboard file simply create an HTML file and place it into the web/pages or web/public folder.  

Pages in the web/pages folder must be postfixed with .shtm (secure html).

Pages in the web/public folder must be postfixed with .htm

Any private page can be accessed via:

yourMangoHost:yourMangoPort/ui/<your dashboard name>.shtm

Examples:
localhost:8080/ui/defaultDashbaord.shtm
localhost:8080/ui/helloWorld.shtm

Public pages can be accessed via:
