<p>The dashboards settings allow configuration of what files are presented and the URLs to use to present them to users.</p>

<h3>Public Dashboards</h3>
<p>Public dashboards are accessible to anyone, even users not logged in.  Be aware that to access any data within Mango 
there must be an active User session for that page.</p>
<h4>Public URL prefix</h4>
<p>This setting is the base URL for users to use to access public files.  This value must be postfixed with a slash for the mapping to work.</p>
<h4>Public files location</h4>
<p>This setting is the directory within the module that contains the public files.  This value must be postfixed with a slash for the mapping to work.</p>

<h3>Private Dashboards</h3>
<p>Private dashboards are accessible only to logged in users.  If a user that is not logged in tries to access the page they are either directed to the Mango 
login page, or if a value is set in the login page property then they are directed to that page.</p>
<h4>Private URL prefix</h4>
<p>This setting is the base URL for users to use to access private files.  This value must be postfixed with a slash for the mapping to work.</p>
<h4>Private files location</h4>
<p>This setting is the directory within the module that contains the private files.  This value must be postfixed with a slash for the mapping to work.</p>

<h3>Icon Settings</h3>
<p>The icon is the image shown on the Mango Toolbar. The <b>icon location</b> is the path within the module to the icon file, do not prefix with a slash. 
The <b>icon destination</b> is the url where the user will be directed when clicking on the icon.</p>

<h3>Login page</h3>
<p>This setting allows the user to override the login page for Mango.  For example to direct users to the public/login.htm page the value would be /public-dashboards/login.htm. Use with caution as all non-logged in users will be directed to this page so if it 
is broken no one will be able to login until this setting is changed.  If this happens just run this SQL on the database, 'DELETE dashboards.login.page from systemSettings' to remove the bad mapping.
